 Next, let's welcome Chairman Ren Deqi,
 the Party Secretary and Chairman of the Transportation Bank,
 to the forum.
 Please.
 Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman,
 dear leaders, dear guests,
 good afternoon, everyone.
 Today, we gather in the City Hall
 to discuss the integration of human resources and finance.
 On behalf of the Transportation Bank,
 I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all the leaders and guests
 for their long-term support to the Transportation Bank
 and for their warm words and sincere thanks.
 Secretary-General Xi Jinping pointed out
 that human resources and finance
 are essential forces for the technological revolution
 and the transformation of the industry.
 Human resources and finance,
 along with their digitalized and automated transformation,
 are able to carry out hundreds of jobs
 with their unprecedented breadth and depth.
 In order to accelerate the development of new production power
 and increase productivity,
 we have experienced that
 human resources and finance
 are constantly accelerating
 the digitalization and transformation
 of the operating institutions.
 In terms of customer service,
 product creation,
 process management,
 and risk prevention and control,
 they have greatly improved
 the efficiency of financial services
 and the experience of customer service.
 At the same time,
 the integration of human resources and finance
 has also led to a series of new risks,
 new challenges,
 and a series of new challenges.
 We need to seize the opportunity
 to pay attention to safety,
 and to strictly implement
 the policy and capacity
 of business development.
 At the opening ceremony yesterday,
 Secretary-General Li Qiang emphasized
 that human resources and finance
 need to ensure that they can improve themselves
 and strengthen co-operative governance.
 At this conference,
 we have presented
 the Shanghai Declaration of Human Resources
 and Global Governance,
 which advocates the value of
 more development,
 more security,
 and more governance.
 At present,
 the integration of human resources and finance
 and development
 has reached a new stage.
 Human resources and finance
 need to improve themselves
 and become a key topic
 for industry development.
 The Jiao Teng Bank has held a forum
 to focus on human resources and finance
 for the development of health,
 sustainability,
 and security,
 and to build the core of digital finance
 and build an open exchange platform.
 We have invited the government,
 the top universities,
 the financial industry,
 and the leaders of technology companies
 to give their opinion
 and to work together
 to develop the five financial articles.
 Over the past few years,
 the Jiao Teng Bank has been
 providing guidance
 and strong support
 to the Shanghai City Government
 to work closely with the international community
 to actively promote the integration
 of human resources and finance
 into the operating institutions.
 This will enable the Jiao Teng Bank
 to develop the five financial articles
 for the development of the financial system,
 to investigate the needs of consumers,
 and to achieve product positioning
 to provide a more efficient
 and convenient financial service
 for the actual economy.
 Second,
 it will continue to develop the Jiao Teng Bank
 for the management of the financial system,
 to promote the implementation
 of the Jiao Teng Bank
 to strengthen the financial support,
 to improve the operation process,
 and to improve the management of operations.
 Third,
 it will fully implement the Jiao Teng Bank
 to strengthen the risk management,
 to strengthen the risk prevention and control,
 to control the rule of law
 and the right to return the rights,
 and to improve the financial security.
 Today,
 we will publish
 the Jiao Teng Bank
 for the management of the financial system,
 to combine the innovation results
 of the Jiao Teng Bank
 with the Jiao Teng Bank
 and to share the advanced experience
 of the Jiao Teng Bank.
 At the same time,
 as a strategic partner
 of the Jiao Teng Bank,
 the Jiao Teng Bank
 will also have a special exhibition
 to show the latest
 innovation results
 of the Jiao Teng Bank.
 I welcome everyone
 to come together to guide us.
 Dear leaders,
 dear guests,
 the Jiao Teng Bank
 will continue to improve
 and expand the Jiao Teng Bank.
 Not only will it
 give us
 good expectations for the future,
 but it will also
 give us common goals
 and responsibilities.
 Through this forum discussion,
 we will promote
 the collaboration
 and development
 of the Jiao Teng Bank
 with the Jiao Teng Bank
 and ask for resources
 to improve the convenience
 of financial services,
 compete with each other,
 and improve our intelligence
 and power.
 Finally,
 I wish this forum
 to be successful.
 Thank you.
 Thank you,
 Mr. Ren,
 for your wonderful speech.
 Please enter.
 Mr. Ren,
 based on the current situation
 of the Jiao Teng Bank,
 you have expressed your opinion
 on the issue of
 open and controlled
 intelligence.
 Of course,
 we can't leave
 the construction of the system
 for common governance.
 Next,
 we will enter
 the main speech
 of this forum.
 First of all,
 let's welcome
 Mr. Xiao Gang,
 the former chairman
 of the China Regulatory Commission,
 to speed up the construction
 of the artificial intelligence
 governance system.
 Please.
 Hello,
 friends.
 I am Xiao Gang,
 the former president
 of the International
 Anti-In話
ова Theft Service.
 I am taking
 Give him a mic.
 Okay, thank you.
 Chairman Ren, Vice President Li Dongrong,
 guests and friends, good afternoon.
 It's an honor for me to attend this conference and forum.
 According to the theme of the forum,
 I would like to talk about the problem of the artificial intelligence governance system
 and my own views and insights.
 Two days ago, on July 2,
 China submitted an international agreement to the 78th United Nations
 on the construction of an artificial intelligence international cooperation.
 This agreement was signed by the United Nations.
 This agreement was signed by the United Nations.
 This agreement was signed by the United Nations.
 It was a joint purchase of the United Nations.
 It was a joint purchase of the United Nations.
 It was a joint purchase of the United Nations.
 Yesterday the Global Agribusiness University in Shanghai
 held an international forum for pilots.
 It was a global forum for pilots.
 Yesterday, it verte shopping and showing what works
 to cover problems.
 The organization also tried to promote license
 to professional analysts andtery by the급

 Therefore,
 if you are interested
 to participate in this education forum for taught
 is an important contribution and role in the global AI system.
 The AI system is actually a common problem that humans face.
 AI has brought great opportunities to the world,
 but it also brings new challenges.
 So I say that opportunities and challenges coexist.
 On this issue, we are all facing the same problem.
 So how do we build an open, fair, and efficient governance system and mechanism
 to take care of all mankind?
 This is a common problem that we all face.
 There are several characteristics of the current AI.
 The first is that the industrial world is leading the advanced AI.
 The second is that the industrial world is leading the advanced AI.
 That is to say, according to last year's data,
 in 2023, there will be 51 well-known machine learning models developed by the industrial world.
 There will be only 15 models developed by the academic world.
 Of course, there will be 21 models developed by the industrial world.
 The second characteristic is that there will be more open-source basic models.
 There will be more and more open-source models.
 Last year's data shows that 149 basic models were released in 2023.
 That is twice as many as in 2022.
 Of those, 65.77% are open-source models.
 In the previous year, last year, and the year before,
 33% of the open-source models were released in 2021.
 In 2022, 44% of the open-source models will be released.
 More and more open-source models will be released.
 The third characteristic is that the large, advanced models are getting more and more expensive.
 Because the computing power and data are getting more and more expensive.
 According to data statistics,
 OpenAI's GPT-4 will cost about $78 million.
 Google's Gemini and Archer will cost about $1.9 billion.
 It is getting more and more expensive.
 The fourth characteristic is that the number of AI patents and publications is growing explosively.
 From this,
 the comparison between the top AI in China and the United States
 shows that we have both advantages and differences.
 According to the data,
 among the top models in 2023,
 the United States developed about 61.
 The European Union developed 21.
 China developed 15.
 But if you look at the number of AI patents in the world,
 China is ahead.
 China is 61%.
 China is 61%.
 And the United States is only 20%.
 20.9%.
 Of course,
 we all know that
 the AI brings a lot of potential threats.
 I won't go into details.
 For example,
 the problem of AI weaponization.
 The problem of AI rebuilding the country's competitive advantage.
 And the problem of AI matching.
 That is to say,
 how AI and human values match.
 And the problem of AI trust.
 And the problem of AI's development.
 The market monopoly.
 The impact on employment.
 And privacy and security.
 The prejudice and discrimination.
 And so on.
 These risks.
 The potential risks are getting bigger and bigger.
 So, from a global perspective,
 the competition of AI in various countries
 has gone from the field of technology
 to the field of rules and regulations.
 How is that?
 On the one hand,
 it is the peak of technology.
 On the other hand,
 it is the peak of rules and regulations.
 Rules and language rights.
 Here,
 I have listed
 the progress of international organizations
 and major countries
 in terms of the rules and regulations
 of AI.
 For example,
 the United Nations has issued
 a proposal on the theory of AI.
 It has been approved by 120 countries.
 Including China.
 It has also issued
 a proposal on the management of AI
 based on human nature.
 These important documents.
 China has issued
 a proposal on the management of AI in the world.
 At the same time,
 it has also launched
 the AI Act in China.
 It is currently in preparation.
 The United States has also issued an executive order.
 The European Union has issued
 the Act on AI.
 As for machines,
 they also have
 the guidelines of international AI.
 The international behavior standards
 developed by advanced AI systems.
 So,
 28 countries including China,
 the United States,
 and the European Union
 have jointly signed
 the Burekili Artificial Intelligence Security Declaration.
 And the first AI Security Summit
 held last year in 2023.
 The OECD and G20
 have similar guidelines.
 Finally,
 I would like to sum up
 a basic conclusion.
 Now,
 countries are very much aware
 of the rules of the governance system.
 There is cooperation
 and consensus.
 But at the same time,
 there is fierce competition
 between them.
 They are all fighting for
 the right to speak.
 Moreover,
 from different international organizations
 and different countries,
 there is still a lot of difference
 in the form of legislation,
 the organization of institutions,
 the order of priority,
 and the power of supervision.
 These countries are not completely the same.
 There is still a difference.
 China has also issued
 the Burekili Artificial Intelligence Security Declaration.
 Last year,
 in 2023,
 President Xi Jinping
 issued the Burekili Artificial Intelligence Security Declaration.
 So,
 there are six aspects to this.
 First,
 stick to human rights
 and improve our intelligence.
 Second,
 respect each other,
 and protect each other.
 Third,
 establish a level assessment system
 for risk.
 That is,
 security,
 reliability,
 and fairness.
 Fourth,
 fully respect the policies
 and practices of each country,
 and form a broad and consistent
 governance framework
 and standard regulations.
 China's initiative
 is to respect the differences,
 but also to have a common,
 consistent
 standard regulation
 and governance framework.
 Fifth,
 support the discussion
 of establishing
 an international
 artificial intelligence
 governance institution
 under the framework
 of the United Nations.
 This is a problem
 that is now
 a big controversy
 in each country.
 Some countries have proposed
 an international
 governance institution
 like the Artificial Intelligence
 Organization.
 Others have proposed
 an institution under the
 United Nations.
 So,
 how to set up
 an international
 artificial intelligence
 institution?
 How to set up
 such an institution?
 Now,
 there is a big
 difference
 between each country.
 China's position
 is to support
 the discussion
 and establishment
 of such an international
 institution under the framework
 of the United Nations.
 There is still a lot
 to discuss
 in the next step.
 The last one is
 international cooperation
 and assistance
 for developing countries.
 China is also
 a very important
 representative
 of developing countries.
 So,
 how to
 fuse
 the gap
 between
 artificial intelligence
 and governance
 should take
 a lot of
 measures
 in this regard.
 As you know,
 in March this year,
 the EU
 passed
 the Artificial Intelligence
 Act.
 I think
 this is
 the first
 draft
 of a comprehensive
 Artificial Intelligence Act.
 It should be said that
 it has marked
 a new stage
 in the global
 supervision
 of artificial intelligence.
 So,
 the basic principles
 of the European
 Artificial Intelligence Act
 are as follows.
 One is to protect
 fundamental rights,
 democracy,
 rule of law,
 and sustainable environment.
 The other is to promote
 the innovative application
 of artificial intelligence.
 The innovative application.
 So,
 when I study
 the European
 Artificial Intelligence Act,
 a very important feature
 is the division
 between the four levels.
 There are four levels.
 One is an unacceptable
 level.
 That is,
 there are some
 ranges.
 The other is
 high risk,
 medium risk,
 and low risk.
 Each level
 has different
 adaptation
 standards.
 In addition,
 the European Union
 has also clarified
 the negative list,
 which areas
 are not allowed
 to use artificial intelligence.
 This is very clear.
 So,
 now,
 the supervision
 of AI
 is
 getting
 more and more
 intensified.
 Here,
 I quote
 the former chairman
 of the United Nations
 Communications Commission,
 Tom Feller.
 He wrote a report
 on the history
 of AI supervision.
 His basic
 point of view
 is that
 the supervision
 of new technologies
 is never
 an obstacle
 to development.
 It is not
 an obstacle
 to development.
 Instead,
 it is to reduce
 the effect
 of application development.
 So,
 the whole world
 is studying
 the issue
 of AI supervision.
 I think
 the current
 AI supervision
 faces three problems.
 The first one
 is that the rules
 of supervision
 cannot be followed
 by the technology.
 As you all know,
 AI's technology
 is quite fast.
 Our rules
 of supervision
 cannot be followed.
 The other one
 is that it is not
 fast enough.
 The rules
 of supervision
 are not fast enough.
 The second one
 is that the way
 of supervision
 does not adapt
 to various
 application scenarios.
 Excessive supervision
 is not enough.
 Who is in charge?
 How is it managed?
 How effective is it?
 How accurate is it?
 This still needs
 further exploration.
 Our country
 has always
 paid great attention
 to the supervision
 of AI.
 There are three rules
 for the supervision
 of AI in the deep city.
 I will not read
 them here.
 I will list them
 at the top.
 There are three rules
 for the integration
 of AI in the deep city.
 From the training stage
 to the development stage
 of the model,
 to the product operation stage,
 there are detailed rules.
 These rules
 have already been implemented.
 These rules
 have already been implemented.
 Therefore,
 I think China
 needs to speed up
 the AI system.
 We have good
 foundations
 and conditions.
 We also have
 our characteristics.
 I think these characteristics
 are the characteristics
 of our development
 of AI.
 The first one
 is that we are
 focused on
 the negative energy
 of the physical economy,
 the development
 of new productivity,
 the way
 of production
 and the production
 rate of all elements.
 This is the purpose
 of our development
 of AI.
 The second one
 is that we have
 rich data resources
 and application scenarios.
 We have advanced
 new infrastructure.
 We have a complete
 industrial chain
 and ecological circle.
 We have a large-scale
 market.
 The third one
 is that we have
 a new
 grid system
 and innovation-driven
 market mechanism.
 China's
 paper and patent
 on AI
 and some
 technologies
 are leading
 the development
 of AI.
 The third one
 is that we have
 young talent
 in China.
 These young
 and outstanding
 talents
 are constantly
 emerging
 and promoting
 the innovation
 and breakthrough
 of big models.
 To accelerate
 the AI
 governance system
 in China,
 I think
 there are
 a few problems
 that we need
 to stick to.
 The first one
 is the basic
 principle.
 Of course,
 it is to stick
 to the values
 and the rules.
 In the relationship
 of cohesion,
 development,
 and safety,
 I think
 non-development
 is the biggest
 danger.
 Development
 is the premise,
 and safety
 is the guarantee.
 On the issue
 of promotion
 and regulation,
 promotion
 is the end.
 Regulation
 is a means
 to develop
 with supervision
 and control
 with application.
 Without
 widespread
 application,
 especially
 in China,
 I think
 it is necessary
 to develop
 and apply
 for governance
 with supervision
 and control.
 On the basic principle,
 I think
 there are several aspects.
 The central government
 has repeatedly
 suggested,
 including
 the initiative
 proposed by China,
 harmony,
 friendship,
 fairness,
 fairness,
 justice,
 tolerance,
 sharing,
 respect,
 privacy,
 safety,
 control,
 responsibility,
 and
 integration.
 The first
 aspect of
 a comprehensive
 law is
 to
 make
 the
 law
 more
 inclusive
 in
 each
 context.
 The second
 aspect is
 to
 make
 the law
 more
 comprehensive,
 and
 the
 national
 law
 should
 be
 inclusive
 For example, smart medicine and smart finance.
 In these areas, we have special regulations under the comprehensive law.
 We should follow the comprehensive law and the long-term regulations.
 In addition, I suggest that we should follow the hard law and the soft law and the rules.
 Some things need laws, some things need soft laws and rules.
 And when setting these rules and laws, we should pay special attention to the space for rejuvenation and innovation development.
 The third is basic responsibility.
 Whether it's rules or laws, we need to understand the boundaries of the developers, providers, users, and regulators.
 We need to set the space for responsibility for the main issues related to the entire life cycle of the entire industrial chain.
 In the basic mechanism,
 which is responsibility for the entire life cycle,
 I think there are a few things we need to pay more attention to.
 First, I think we should also manage the risk classification and classification of risk.
 Especially the classification and classification of risk, we need to manage the distribution and the granularity.
 We can't manage it in a general way.
 In addition, based on the scene, we need to have the discipline of the industry.
 We need to play the role of the institutions that are self-reliant.
 In addition, we need to take the mode of positive and negative list.
 In addition, we need to take the mode of positive and negative list.
 In the management method, we can take a univocal and transparent management.
 This includes the whole process of evaluation, monitoring, and audit.
 So we should further establish a innovative and friendly management,
 encourage innovation and demonstration.
 Finally, of course, this management problem also needs comprehensive and comprehensive coordination and professional management.
 These two relationships need to be dealt with.
 On the one hand, the entire artificial intelligence needs to have a unified department and a comprehensive legal system.
 At the same time, because of the application of artificial intelligence,
 there are a lot of professional and professional supervision.
 How to combine these two, it also needs to be studied.
 I will share these. If there is anything wrong, please criticize and point out.
 Thank you, everyone.
 Okay, thank you. Thank you, President Xiao Gang, for a wonderful speech.
 Thank you.
 President Xiao Gang, please enter the stage.
 President Xiao Gang, based on the current status of industrial development and the trend of technological development,
 you have explained to us the necessity and urgency of establishing an artificial intelligence management system.
 Next, we will invite a guest to the stage.
 He is the former vice-executive director of the People's Bank of China, Mr. Li Dongrong.
 He will bring us a talk that will steadily promote the application of artificial intelligence in finance
 and assist the innovation and development of digital finance.
 Thank you all.
 Dear President Xiao Gang, Chairman De Qi,
 Good afternoon, guests.
 Yesterday afternoon, we came to Shanghai.
 The Potmiel is at 38 degrees Celsius, which allows us to understand the heat in Shanghai.
 Next, I will speak to President Xiao Gang.
 I was at the conference hall of the AI Conference.
 When I entered the hall, I felt the high interest of the society
 and the high interest of AI in the world.
 People were very interested and interested.
 I felt that the AI conference
 really attracted a lot of attention.
 We know that AI is the core industry of the new generation of information technology,
 the key driving force leading the technological revolution
 and the innovation of the industry.
 It has become an important engine for the development of new production power.
 In recent years, the rapid development of AI,
 especially the widespread attention and application of the universal AI technology,
 has become a strategic technology that leads to the future.
 Finance is an important core competitiveness of the country,
 which promotes AI and finance
 and is deeply integrated.
 It is a key and important way to implement the national AI development strategy.
 It is an important content that promotes the construction of modern financial systems
 and has a very important real meaning.
 Next, I would like to talk about my personal thoughts
 on how to steadily promote AI financial applications.
 If there is anything wrong, please criticize the evidence.
 I will talk about three aspects of the problem.
 First, the application of AI in the financial field is accelerating.
 The first is that the country pays great attention to the development of AI.
 As early as July 2017,
 the State Council issued a notice
 on the implementation of the new generation of AI development plans.
 This is the first system deployment document
 of the AI industry published by our country.
 After that, the Central Committee of the Party,
 the State Council of the State,
 and related departments
 have repeatedly issued opinions
 about the relevant regulations
 guiding the development of AI.
 These contents cover the basic facilities such as
 planning and layout,
 application scenarios and key tasks,
 theoretical regulations,
 governance principles,
 standard system construction,
 the integration of high-efficiency AI students,
 and other aspects of AI development.
 With the great push of the country,
 the AI industry in our country is developing rapidly.
 At present,
 the core industrial scale of AI in our country
 has exceeded 500 billion yuan,
 and the number of enterprises has exceeded 4,300.
 It is estimated that by 2035,
 the scale of AI in our country
 will be 173 trillion yuan,
 and it may reach 30.6%
 in the global scale.
 AI is penetrating into various industries and industries
 with the so-called vastness and depth of the past.
 The development of various major achievements
 and breakthroughs
 is also continuing.
 Second,
 the AI policy environment of the financial industry
 is continuously being optimized.
 Finance is an information-intensive industry.
 Its information-based practical exploration
 and universal application
 have always been at the forefront of all industries.
 For a long time,
 the financial industry has been actively promoting
 and directly benefiting
 new technology applications,
 especially the current one.
 The financial system is responding to the national strategy
 and is actively embracing AI.
 It is becoming one of the best scenarios
 for the application of AI.
 In 2022,
 the People's Bank of China
 has released a development plan for financial technology.
 During the 13th and 15th years,
 it pointed out that the application of
 large-data AI technology and financial applications
 will be effective.
 It also proposed a new opportunity
 to capture the global development of AI
 and promote AI technology
 as a basis for human beings.
 In addition,
 it also proposed a new approach
 to deepening applications in the financial sector.
 In recent years,
 the People's Bank of China has also developed
 and published the financial industry standards
 of AI financial applications
 based on the standards of
 AI financial applications,
 information disclosure guidelines,
 and other industry standards.
 From the basic requirements
 of AI financial applications,
 evaluation methods,
 judgment rules,
 and the information disclosure principles
 and forms of AI calculations
 in the financial industry application process,
 it has effectively promoted
 the deepening applications of AI
 in the financial sector.
 The third is the rapid expansion
 of the financial industry
 AI application scene.
 From the application scene,
 knowledge map,
 biological characteristics identification,
 and machine process automation,
 especially the AI technology
 represented by the large model,
 in the publication of information,
 extraction and generation,
 data analysis,
 employee assistant,
 code writing,
 and other aspects,
 it has effectively improved
 the productivity efficiency
 and reduced operating costs.
 And in the application of
 AI customer service,
 customer interaction,
 and quantification investment,
 the application is also
 getting deeper and deeper.
 It has continuously improved
 the customer experience,
 innovated the service model,
 and improved the service efficiency.
 From the institutional aspect,
 the People's Bank of China
 is the pioneer
 in the integration and development
 of AI technology.
 They actively use
 artificial intelligence
 and big data technology,
 to establish a new management
 and management model
 that perfects data drive,
 to accelerate the promotion
 of smart bank construction,
 to accelerate the establishment
 of artificial intelligence
 and negative energy system
 based on large-model technology,
 to increase the investment
 of artificial intelligence
 in some shareholder banks,
 to continuously promote
 the application of large-model technology
 in retail scenarios
 such as smart wealth assistance,
 employee learning training,
 and other internal scenarios.
 Yesterday afternoon,
 I met President Xiao Gang
 at the meeting,
 and we saw that
 the transportation bank
 is actively using
 these models.
 In terms of credit,
 they are actively promoting
 the application of
 artificial intelligence
 and internal employees
 as well.
 As far as I know,
 there are other banks
 such as Beijing Bank
 and many other banks
 that are also actively
 promoting
 these related model applications
 internally,
 so that
 the knowledge
 and wisdom
 of the entire industry
 are integrated
 into the large model
 to achieve
 a better
 performance
 for the employees.
 Next,
 I would like to
 talk about
 the second question.
 This is a question
 that we should pay attention
 to during
 the application
 of artificial intelligence.
 The development
 of artificial intelligence
 requires a comprehensive
 calculation
 and data
 of three core elements.
 The three elements
 are interconnected
 and inseparable.
 The calculation
 is the core element,
 the data
 is the foundation,
 and the computing
 is the drive.
 While promoting
 the development
 of artificial intelligence,
 the application
 of artificial intelligence
 may be a problem.
 The first is
 the black box
 of the algorithm,
 the discrimination
 of the algorithm,
 the defect of the model,
 and the potential risks
 such as
 difficult to explain.
 Due to the
 inconspicuous
 or confidentiality
 of the algorithm,
 it is difficult
 to determine
 the fairness
 of the algorithm,
 which may lead
 to discrimination
 of the algorithm.
 The AI
 as a
 information system
 without
 the structure
 of the formula
 is difficult
 to determine
 the same output.
 The relationship
 between input
 and output
 is difficult
 to determine.
 The result
 is not accurate,
 the process
 is difficult
 to evaluate,
 and the cause
 is difficult
 to explain.
 How to
 understand
 and use
 this feature
 requires
 continuous
 summary
 and improvement
 in practice.
 It also
 requires
 corresponding
 regulations
 and systems
 to be implemented
 in the future.
 The cost of
 algorithm
 is high,
 and the resources
 need to be
 further
 reimbursed.
 The algorithm
 is the
 foundation
 of AI.
 Data shows
 that the demand
 for AI
 is growing rapidly.
 Last year,
 the market
 of AI
 in China
 reached
 6.64 billion yuan,
 which is
 82.5%
 of the total
 growth.
 The development
 of the
 digital economy
 in China
 is
 still
 a long
 process.
 The cost
 of
 AI
 is
 also
 high.
 The cost
 of
 AI
 is
 high.
 The cost
 of
 AI
 is
 high.
 The cost
 of
 AI
 is
 high.
 The cost
 of
 AI
 is
 very high.
 And
 the cost
 of AI
 is
 very high.
 Within
 the
 international
 market,
 the cost
 of AI
 is
 relatively
 small.
 But
 I
 have
 to
 answer
 the
 most
 important
 question to
 all
 of
 you.
 The
 question
 is
 where
 the
 right
 way
 to

 to
 AI is the foundation for deep learning of algorithms.
 Without data, AI will be trapped in a 5-meter gap.
 AI applications, especially in the process of large-scale training,
 face a lot of data acquisition and processing data leak risk
 and algorithmic individualization analysis of users,
 which brings risks of user privacy leakage.
 It is extremely important to ensure data security and protect users' privacy.
 At the same time, unbalanced problems such as data quality, data bias, and sample data
 directly affect the performance of AI model output.
 In addition, AI applications are subject to technical and risk misjudgment,
 ethical and moral issues.
 This needs to be paid attention to.
 Next, I will talk about the third question.
 There are five recommendations for AI applications in the field of finance.
 First, we need to stick to the principle of human beings and technology.
 Second, we need to stick to the principle of finance.
 Third, we need to respect the common interests and legal rights of consumers
 and the common values of society.
 Fourth, we need to develop smart financial products that are warm.
 Fifth, when financial institutions promote AI applications,
 they need to uphold the legal and ethical guidelines,
 and they need to respect the principles of AI and education training.
 In the process of data acquisition, algorithmic design, product development, and application,
 we need to avoid prejudice and algorithmic discrimination
 that involve nationality, faith, gender, age, and profession.
 Second, we need to strengthen risk monitoring and infrastructure infrastructure.
 We need to pay attention to the traditional financial risks and new risks
 that AI applications may bring,
 and we need to continue to build on the bottom line of safety,
 strengthen the safe management of AI technology,
 strengthen information disclosure,
 algorithmic memorization,
 flow management,
 and security certification.
 We need to improve the explicability and predictability of AI,
 and ensure human trust in machine behavior.
 At the same time, we need to strengthen the application of AI in the field of financial monitoring.
 We need to continue to improve the financial risk of the monitoring department itself,
 and ensure the application of AI in the field of financial monitoring.
 We need to fully play a role of high-quality development and leadership
 to support the high-quality development of the financial industry.
 Under the general framework of the national AI standard system,
 we need to continue to promote the construction of the financial industry
 and the AI application standard system.
 Third, we need to strengthen the safety of data and protect consumers.
 We need to strengthen the safety of data and risk prevention and protection
 of consumers in the AI financial applications.
 We need to strengthen the safety of data and protect consumers in the financial applications.
 We need to strengthen the safety of data and protect consumers in the financial applications.
 We need to strengthen the supervision and management of the data collection,
 processing, storage, and output of AI data,
 and explore the risk of data leakage in the model training process
 by replacing the original data training and verification of large models
 through integrated data.
 We need to strengthen the security of the data location
 and the data security of the financial industry
 under the premise of protecting personal privacy,
 commercial secrets, and sensitive data,
 and provide high-quality basic data
 for the financial industry to use AI.
 We need to guide and educate the industry
 to adopt the requirements of consumer protection
 into the company governance, corporate culture construction,
 and business development strategy,
 and design and adapt the customer's operating habits and capabilities
 to different customer habits and capabilities to the company.

 After many years of information-based construction,
 financial institutions have accumulated a large number of structured data
 and data processing experience,
 but they are far from big models.
 In the specific implementation,
 on the one hand, it is necessary to urgently instruct the data type,
 strengthen data governance,
 improve data quality,
 and establish a business that accumulates data elements.
 Data elements are converted into data assets,
 and data assets are a necessary mechanism to counteract business development.
 On the other hand,
 it is necessary to establish a high-efficiency and stable data tag management system,
 to distinguish, clean, and process training data,
 to ensure that the data support is strong,
 to mark professional unity,
 and to provide a solid foundation for modeling.
 The fourth is to promote large-model ecological construction
 and actively develop model management.
 Large-model research and development has the characteristics of talent,
 technology, and capital,
 and is usually led by a small number of high-performance research and development organizations.
 Currently, the number of domestic large-model models has exceeded 200.
 On the one hand,
 large-model research and development lacks the support of innovative original theory,
 which leads to a serious synchronization of technical routes.
 On the other hand,
 while exploring large and strong universal models,
 it is necessary to combine specific application scenarios
 to increase investment in small and beautiful vertical industry model resources.
 It is recommended to play a reasonable role in industrial upstream and downstream,
 to promote industrial innovation
 and deep integration of research and development,
 to establish a national industry-based plan,
 to build a good ecosystem that is controllable,
 sustainable, complementary, and healthy for sustainable development.
 At the same time,
 it is necessary to vigorously promote responsible model management,
 to resolve model decision-making that does not transparent
 and difficult to whitewash,
 to ensure that artificial intelligence is legal, safe, and effective,
 including the establishment of model evaluation and monitoring mechanisms.
 The fifth is to improve AI engineering,
 to improve AI engineering talent training.
 AI engineering talent is the key talent to promote AI technology innovation and application.
 It plays an important role in digital transformation,
 to actively train AI engineering talent teams.
 On the one hand,
 it is necessary to create a knowledge-based,
 skill-based, and innovative engineering talent team
 by self-training, deep collaboration, and so on.
 On the other hand,
 it is necessary to use the introduction of talent,
 digestion, absorption, and reasonable flow
 to fully stimulate innovative vitality.
 These are some of my thoughts and opinions on artificial intelligence,
 application, and logic management.
 If there is anything wrong,
 I would like to ask the leaders and experts to criticize and point out.
 Jiao Tong Bank is willing to work together with you
 to improve our intelligence,
 open up the consensus,
 and share the beautiful future of the digital age.
 Thank you.
 Thank you, President Qin, for your wonderful sharing.
 We saw Jiao Tong Bank
 in a very vivid practice
 in our technology revolution,
 especially how to use the new production power
 to make digital finance big articles.
 Next, let's welcome
 Mr. Zhang Jianhua,
 the former president of Huaxia Bank,
 a researcher at Wudaokou Financial College,
 Tsinghua University.
 He will bring us
 the open model of public data
 and the real thinking of value.
 Let's welcome him.
 President Zhang Jianhua.
 President Zhang.
 President Xiaogang.
 Chairman Dong.
 Chairman Dejin.
 Good afternoon,
 leaders and guests.
 I would like to share
 with you some information
 about the use of public data
 through today's forum.
 We know that
 the main source of artificial intelligence
 is the data.
 The data is divided into public data,
 the government's data,
 the data we have and the private data we have.
 Public data accounts for more than three-fifths of the total data we have in our society.
 So the problem of open public data is actually a very big problem.
 So today I want to talk about a relatively narrow topic,
 which is the open public data model and its value realization.
 These three parts, the simple part is the value of data,
 the open public data model, and the way it is realized.
 We don't need to talk about the value of public data.
 We all know that because I don't want to talk about the relationship of time.
 The demand for data is very high.
 The development of artificial intelligence is ultimately inseparable from data.
 So there are a lot of public data.
 We are talking about the development of artificial intelligence.
 What kind of data do we need?
 What kind of data do we need in the process?
 What kind of research and development data do we need?
 From the production and processing of data to the end,
 there is a whole process.
 There is a huge demand for artificial intelligence in our society.
 There are several data elements in it.
 One is that our country is very important.
 And then from the global industrial chain,
 it is said that improving economic efficiency and increasing the production rate of all sources of power
 is the biggest function of data.
 This is the biggest function of data.
 We don't need to talk about all of this.
 This is the potential value of public data.
 We don't need to talk about all of this.
 The point is that we want to talk about our own research.
 Our recent research is also a real evidence.
 This is just a preliminary conclusion.
 We have already talked about public data.
 We want to talk about the existing open model of public data.
 We have summarized more than 290 cities across the country.
 Now, basically, all of them have open methods.
 The government's public data is all on...
 Some of them are open by themselves through this department.
 Some of them are open platforms.
 Some of them are connected to a operating institution.
 The government entrusts a special institution to operate.
 There are different modes.
 There are two kinds of open modes.
 One is an open platform belonging to the government.
 The other is to entrust an operating institution.
 Of course, this operating institution is not just one.
 It will not put all the data together.
 The mode is different.
 Some places put all the data together in one operating institution.
 Some places call it a branch area.
 In Beijing, it is called a branch area.
 Because we study more about finance.
 The data about finance is related to finance.
 It is a branch area.
 For transportation, for health,
 it may be a different branch area.
 It may be a different mode in other places.
 This is what we call an open mode belonging to an operating institution.
 These modes...
 For all of our conclusions,
 it is interesting to say that
 everything that is open has a contribution to economic growth.
 It also has an effect on local innovation.
 But the effect is different.
 This is...
 In fact, it is the same in all countries.
 Our country has always emphasized that data should be open.
 Including our government data.
 Why did we build so many public open platforms for government data?
 It is also to implement some of our country's relevant...
 requirements.
 Some policies.
 It is the same in other countries.
 Europe and the United States have their own requirements for open data.
 For example, in Europe,
 when we talk about the construction of open banks,
 we usually talk about how banks can open their own capabilities.
 What is open banking?
 It is to open your API interface.
 It is to connect external data.
 In fact, in Europe,
 the construction of open banks
 requires the bank to open its own data.
 It is actually the same thing,
 but it is different.
 It is because of what?
 Because our banking industry
 may have a great contribution to society
 due to its own data.
 We all know that our financial industry
 is a data-based industry.
 It has a lot of information.
 It has an effect on other areas of society.
 This is to realize the value of open data.
 There are some policies in each country.
 I won't talk much about this.
 I just want to talk about
 some of the results of our own research.
 From what I just mentioned,
 there are three kinds of open models.
 The main two are the big ones.
 One is the one with special operations,
 exclusive operations,
 and the theme of the market supply chain.
 These are all different cities.
 But there are two types of big ones.
 One is an open platform
 where all the data is uploaded.
 The other is a commissioning operation.
 They organize and process it.
 This is a benefit.
 This is a disadvantage.
 This includes some of the risks of power,
 how power is distributed,
 and there are some places that are trying to do this.
 But this is all at the beginning.
 I will talk about power later.
 In fact,
 the interest rate mechanism is not yet completely clear.
 So now,
 the responsibility main body of open platform construction
 including the monetization mode of authorization management
 are not yet completely determined.
 They are all part of the initial exploration.
 So we did some simple research on the results.
 The data attack is done in different ways
 in open platform and authorization management.
 Open platform has less dimension.
 The data is not complete.
 And the frequency of the data is not that high.
 The reality is not that strong.
 The biggest problem is that
 there is no one to clean up the data.
 There is no professional organization to organize and process the data.
 It is just an open platform.
 It requires the government to put it up.
 The government has its own responsibility and obligation to put it up.
 There is a requirement.
 This is about open platform.
 The authorization management is relatively good.
 An operating company collects the original data from it.
 It also regularly works with
 the data provider to communicate with it.
 Basically, what can be guaranteed?
 The advantage is that it can guarantee the completeness,
 accuracy, and punctuality of the data.
 It guarantees the quality of the data.
 In the open platform,
 the quality of the data is a little bit worse.
 Including the frequency of the data.
 There are some limitations in all aspects.
 Especially, it includes
 a completely administrative way of arrangement.
 It is not strong.
 For each department,
 it is regarded as a political task.
 Therefore, it lacks a market-based incentive mechanism.
 As for the way of authorization operation,
 because there are operating institutions,
 the operating institutions must be positive.
 But the problem now is that
 their payment model has not been established yet.
 There is no sustainable business model.
 What to collect?
 The original data is not reasonable to collect.
 How to reflect the value of organizing data processing?
 It is not reflected now.
 Therefore, there is a problem with the payment model.
 This is an authorization operation.
 There is a Beijing-style information list.
 There is a lot of information.
 This is just a list of Beijing.
 In fact,
 other places are the same.
 There is a lot of public data of the government.
 Basically, like Beijing,
 there are more than a dozen ministries.
 All of them are included.
 In the financial area of data,
 I just listed a financial area.
 Other areas
 have their own data.
 There is a lot of data.
 These can be seen.
 Our opening now
 is actually more and more.
 There are opening platforms.
 There are more than 290 cities.
 If we look at it at the end,
 it is actually more and more open.
 The data is getting more and more open.
 Since 2017,
 it has been a rapid rise.
 This is the most important thing.
 We want to study it.
 What is the value of opening
 in different modes?
 What is it?
 How is it?
 We did a test.
 For these open platforms,
 different open modes,
 it is related to the local GDP.
 Because everyone knows
 that some places
 can't do land finance now.
 Now some places
 are thinking about data.
 They want to see
 whether the government's data
 can be concentrated
 to produce some value.
 The data must be valuable.
 It will also contribute
 to the local economic growth.
 Our real-time testing
 found that
 the local economy,
 especially its
 financial income,
 has increased.
 It has contributed.
 However,
 it is not
 able to
 be very direct
 to you.
 That is to say,
 we are talking about
 this mechanism.
 It is not directly
 selling data.
 Its core problem
 is that
 after the data is open,
 it will give the industry
 and the industry
 the value
 created by the industry.
 Because it is not
 the real value
 of data.
 The value of data
 is now sold.
 That is to say,
 it is just the value
 of selling data.
 Because now,
 the selling data
 has not started yet.
 However,
 we can see
 that it has contributed
 to the economic growth
 as well as
 the innovation
 and development
 of the enterprise.
 Here,
 we have some data.
 We have analyzed
 the quality
 of public data.
 Some institutions
 have already
 analyzed it.
 I won't go into more detail.
 Including our platforms,
 data volume,
 and how to
 open it up
 to the society
 so that the society
 can read the data.
 However,
 there are also
 some problems
 in terms of
 timeliness
 and feedback channels.
 What you can see
 in real-time
 is that
 only
 10%
 and only
 3%
 of the data
 is updated
 every day.
 4% of the data
 is updated
 every month.
 In other words,
 the rate of updates
 is more than
 two-thirds
 in a year.
 What does this mean?
 Now,
 open platforms
 and data
 are not as open
 as they used to be.
 We all know
 that data
 can't be followed up.
 When you want to
 make a model
 or a stack,
 if you say
 that the data
 from a year ago
 works,
 some may work,
 but most may not.
 So,
 this rate
 is definitely not enough.
 So,
 there are many
 open applications
 for public data.
 I won't go into more detail.
 Now,
 let's talk about
 our research.
 What problems
 are we studying?
 We are studying
 whether
 public data platforms
 are open
 or not.
 What kind of
 results do we get?
 One is
 about
 financial gain.
 How do we calculate
 financial gain?
 Financial income
 is reduced
 by a general
 expenditure.
 Finally,
 it is compared
 to GDP.
 Finally,
 we can see
 how much
 it can account
 for.
 Then,
 there are
 some research
 on innovative
 enterprises.
 The indicators
 we use
 are the
 patent rights
 obtained
 by each
 city.
 The level
 of investment
 by the
 county
 will be
 less than
 the
 market
 level
 of the
 county.
 The cost
 of
 the
 property
 will
 be
 lower
 than
 the
 market
 level.
 That is
 how
 we can
 calculate
 the
 financial
 gain
 We have controlled some variables,
 such as development level, industrial structure,
 degree of opening, cost level, and so on.
 In other words, I consider all these factors
 to eliminate the impact of these factors
 and then look at the value of these opening models.
 What is the final conclusion?
 Simply put, our conclusion is that
 these three models,
 the opening model I just mentioned,
 are all helpful in improving the economy.
 One of them is the one without an open platform
 but has authorization to operate.
 In other words,
 the one with the most authorization to operate
 has the greatest impact.
 It can be increased by about 2%.
 This is not small.
 This is for the total amount.
 For the structure,
 the three models have positive effects
 on local innovation.
 Among them,
 the one with the most authorization to operate
 has the greatest impact.
 In particular,
 the one with two models
 has the greatest impact.
 Because in some places,
 there is a public open platform,
 and all the data is piled up.
 At the same time,
 there are also organizations
 with professional authorization to operate.
 In this way,
 this model has the greatest impact
 on innovation.
 It promotes innovation.
 Later, we also understood that
 the higher the degree of opening of public data,
 the easier it is for people
 to obtain information from the government
 and other public resources.
 It is also easier for the development of
 this model of innovation
 for the general public,
 to promote the development of the local economy.
 Therefore,
 it is fully open.
 It has the contribution to economic growth.
 However,
 if you think about professional services,
 what we may need more
 is some professional data.
 High-quality data
 that has been organized and processed.
 What does this need?
 It needs a so-called
 authorization operating institution
 to operate.
 It can ensure that
 these data are organized,
 the quality of data,
 and at the same time,
 in addition to the original data,
 in addition to ensuring
 the timeliness,
 the completeness,
 and the accuracy of the data
 that we mentioned just now,
 it can also process data products.
 It can organize the original data
 and process it into a data product
 according to your different needs,
 according to the different needs of the institutions.
 For example,
 many institutions in Beijing
 have already added
 all the public data
 and financial institutions
 of the Beijing City
 to its exclusive area.
 What does it provide?
 It provides real-time data
 and data processing
 for the public.
 In addition,
 it also provides
 data processing
 and data processing
 for the public.
 In addition,
 it provides
 a real-time service
 for more than
 3 million businesses
 to all of them.
 Moreover,
 more than 80 banks in Beijing
 are all its clients.
 Now,
 it uses
 the public data.
 We used to say
 that the first half
 of financial technology
 is for retail,
 but what about
 the rest of it?
 What about industrial digital finance?
 In fact,
 the public data of the government
 is often
 the data of business
 which is often
 in the hands of the government
 and not
 the platforms.
 Most of the data on the platform is consumer and retail data.
 The data on the enterprise is mainly on the government.
 The opening up of public data is very important.
 These are the first two conclusions.
 The third conclusion is that the open platform
 has a positive effect on local coordination and development.
 Without the open platform,
 the cooperation and development of authorized businesses is not significant.
 In this picture, the left and right ends of the vertical line
 are all involved,
 which means it is not significant.
 The right-hand side shows that it is significant.
 I won't go into too much detail.
 In short, it is based on the conclusions we have now.
 Finally, the open platform has a positive effect on local economic growth.
 Without the open platform, the cooperation and development of authorized businesses is not significant.
 You have the authorization,
 but you don't open up to the whole society.
 It seems that you are concentrated, the government is concentrated,
 but you don't contribute to the whole society.
 In short, it is based on the conclusions we have now.
 This conclusion is very interesting.
 We have made some preliminary analysis.
 We will go into more detail in the future.
 We will also go into more detail
 about the public data.
 We have only looked at the open platform,
 but not at the data volume.
 For example, the dimension of open data,
 the frequency of open data.
 Now, because it is still
 not divided into more details,
 I think it will be more meaningful to dig into these details further.
 Now, based on the results we have now,
 we can actually get some conclusions.
 That was the conclusion just now.
 These are some external explanations of our research.
 The open platform has a more positive effect on universal and coordinated development.
 The authorization operation has a more positive effect on professionalism and innovation.
 So, if we come to a conclusion now,
 we can say that you need to be fully open to the public.
 That is to say, we have the so-called public open platform.
 This is to promote the development of the whole society
 and your coordinated development,
 the coordinated development of local economy.
 At the same time, in order to improve your professionalism,
 improve your competitiveness and innovation,
 some professional institutions may need to organize and process the data.
 That is to say, the authorization operation model is also needed.
 So, this depends on our future.
 In our whole place,
 in the public space,
 what kind of model is used when local data is running and local data is open?
 It is better to say that both models may exist.
 Of course, if both models exist,
 you are facing a sustainable problem,
 especially the public open one.
 How to ensure that there are people and institutions
 operating and guaranteeing the quality and authenticity of data?
 These are some factors to consider.
 I will share with you the initial research conclusions in relation to time.
 We may go deeper into this in the next step.
 In addition to what we have just talked about,
 we also need to study open data.
 We also need to study the payment model for the future.
 Because the current authorization operation model
 must be paid for.
 Some have already started to pay for it.
 Some have not yet started to pay for it.
 But how to pay for it
 will have a big impact on the future.
 It will have an impact on the use,
 on fairness,
 and on the complete realization of the value of data.
 I think that these will have an impact
 in the future.
 We will continue to analyze it in-depth.
 Thank you, everyone.
 That's all I have to say.
 Thank you for your wonderful speech, Zhang Hang.
 We have seen the effective use of public data
 to promote economic development.
 Of course, the mining of data values
 cannot be separated from advanced models and technologies.
 Next, let's welcome
 the chief technical officer of China's Gongshan Bank,
 Mr. Lv Zhongtao, to share with us
 the wonderful sharing of
 the new model of the financial industry, AI,
 and work practice of co-founding finance services.
 Please.
 Mr. Zhongtao,
 thank you for your esteemed report.
 Thank you, Mr. Lv.
 I am honored to be on this open conference
 to discuss with all the experts
 Today, I would like to share with you three aspects of the content, namely, artificial intelligence to accelerate the digitalization process of the financial industry, the practicality of the AI model of the industrial and commercial banks, and the future of the financial industry AI model.
 Artificial intelligence has undergone multiple technical changes since its first appearance at the DATMOS conference in 1956.
 In 2022, the CHART-GP has brought about a new wave of artificial intelligence, with a model that has a stronger understanding, understanding, and productivity capacity, which has led to the development of the AI model.
 In 2023,
 the Chinese government will introduce a new model of artificial intelligence.
 The Central Financial Work Conference stressed that it would do well to do a big article on digital finance.
 In 2024, the government's work report proposed a new digital economy development to accelerate the development of new productivity, and to carry out the action of AI, which marked the rise of AI as a national strategy.
 The AI technology represented by the DATMOS model is an important engine for the development of new productivity in the financial industry.
 Accelerating the layout and development of DATMOS models is an important engine for the development of new productivity in the financial industry.
 The AI technology represented by the DATMOS model is an important engine for the development of new productivity in the financial industry.
 The coursework of the new Chinese CUR recalls the role of digital automation to develop AI technology and model systems for digital computing dispositions.
 Third, more advanced AI technology withstands the most demanding legal requirements when it brings job opportunities, but the

 We are divided into three stages of overall construction.
 The first stage is the application period for specialized capabilities.
 We have established an AI platform that specializes in artificial intelligence technology.
 Basically, it has the support of AI technology to scale up the business scene.
 The second stage is the application period for enterprises.
 And the third stage is the application period for large-format model.
 Major
 development takes place in a large-format model as a foundation for areas that大家
高技能需要的 Chieren
就在加粟的体系上提升。
 AI assets and AI service sharing, digital operations, and other capabilities
 to realize the comprehensive application of AI large model technology.
 In terms of large model,
 we systematically promote the construction of large model enterprise-level technology capabilities.
 According to the three main pillars,
 one plus X model,
 two full platforms, and eco-friendly construction ideas,
 based on the comprehensive nationalization technology,
 the construction of infrastructure, computing, data, tools,
 capabilities, safety, applications,
 and eco-friendly enterprise-level financial large model technology,
 we will build a new ecosystem of artificial intelligence and finance.
 To ensure the reliability of the technology supply chain,
 the financial industry needs to come up with a model-free,
 accessible domestic large model application.
 Gongshan Bank has built a 1,000-card-scale domesticized AI computing cloud,
 and used technology such as random loading
 to realize a large model,
 and the technology is able to run a large-scale multi-level
 and flexible operation.
 It has a TP-level data,
 and can complete a large-scale,
 multi-level,
 and stable training in a month.
 The related capabilities are not inferior to the English-speaking GPU solutions.
 In addition,
 we have explored a fast-fitting technology route
 for the mainstream large model ecosystem
 that is willing to adapt to the current situation.
 It is able to integrate the large model technology ecosystem,
 which is leading in more than 10 industries,
 to effectively respond to the rapid advancement of large model technology.
 Gongshan Bank's principle of sharing and reusing,
 resource-saving,
 and cost-efficient is the most accurate.
 We have adopted a business-user and open source parallel route,
 and used a wide range of financial data
 and financial large model operation chain,
 building a multi-layer,
 multi-modal and multi-modal
 In our simulation test, our large-model results exceeded GPT-4.
 The quality of the large-model training methods and the quality of the large-model training
 have become the top priority.
 The key is data.
 The large-model era has higher requirements in terms of data quality,
 freshness, comprehensive use in cross-professional fields,
 and rigorousness.
 We need to break down the status quo of each strategic knowledge operation.
 Therefore, we have created a large-model financial knowledge project
 to build a five-layer knowledge structure
 for the world, industry, industry, field, and sport.
 We have built a large-model technology
 with a financial data base of 10 billion tokens.
 Our data size has reached 1.2TB.
 We have used data intelligence processing technology
 to create, collect, clean, manage, and apply
 the intelligent flow of the entire life cycle of knowledge engineering.
 We have updated the financial knowledge efficiency operation mode.
 The overall data production efficiency
 has been increased by more than 10 times in the traditional mode.
 The large-model era of data element market construction
 has contributed to the intelligence of the public sector.
 The Public-Smart Bank has systematically summarized and refined
 the 1 plus X large-model application methods
 and has created and developed
 a standardized engineering solution
 that is integrated with service reasoning.
 We have tried to realize a large-model scale-based application innovation.
 One of them refers to the financial intelligence medium.
 The large-model scale-based application
 uses the ability of the large-model language
 to realize complex tasks,
 solve, plan, and call for tools.
 It can handle more comprehensive and complex tasks
 just like humans.
 In addition,
 in order to solve the large-model
 and standardized knowledge and research problems,
 it is difficult to obtain a large amount of information
 and data analysis, and the threshold is high.
 High-level problems such as low-efficiency
 writing and writing of documents
 are created.
 We have created X professional methods
 such as knowledge detection, data analysis,
 writing and writing of documents,
 and smart search,
 and advanced applications of low-energy business.
 So far,
 the success rate of financial complex tasks
 has reached 90%
 and the satisfaction rate of financial knowledge
 has reached 90%.
 In addition,
 more than 95% of the target accuracy
 has reached the leading level of the industry.
 Next, I would like to introduce
 a typical scene of a commercial bank,
 the business of the financial market.
 In the financial market,
 financial market data workers
 are used as the trade unification entrance,
 surrounding investment analysis,
 transaction execution,
 program management,
 risk monitoring, etc.
 They rely on large models
 to build investment research assistants,
 transaction assistants,
 and business management assistants
 to provide all-round smart services
 to the financial market users
 through dialogue.
 Among them,
 the exchange exchange assistant
 of the exchange office,
 ChatDealing,
 relies on the strategy model of quantification
 to provide smart bid for small-money transactions,
 greatly increasing the coverage efficiency
 and the coverage range of transactions.
 In addition,
 there is a large number of
 smart services
 that can be used to
 increase the coverage of small-money transactions.
 The exchange rate has been increased by threefold.
 Smart bid for small-money transactions
 has reached 50%
 and the price of small-money transactions
 has increased by 40%.
 The transaction profit is over one yuan.
 The large model
 is a deep learning method
 based on a large number of parameters.
 The data is in line with the current model black box,
 with high complexity of calculation,
 and the application has two risks.
 In terms of technical risks,
 one is the lack of
 explicability and controllability.
 In terms of the high complexity of calculation
 of the current model black box,
 there are problems of explicability
 and controllability.
 For example,
 the content of the large model
 may seem logical,
 but it is not true,
 or even a fake fact.
 Second,
 there is a danger of privacy data protection.
 The model is ready to generate
 text information containing personal privacy.
 In terms of the risk of misuse,
 people with other intentions
 can use AI to attack AI.
 For example,
 they can use the ability to generate images
 and video to deceive the business system.
 Financial institutions should pay attention to
 the security impact of large model technical abuse
 and misuse,
 and should be careful
 to avoid the risk of
 misuse and misuse.
 They should take precautions
 to ensure the security of
 financial institutions.
 In terms of the risk of misuse,
 in the process of deep application
 of large models,
 the PRC has established
 a comprehensive security platform
 in three areas,
 such as model security,
 data security,
 and application security.
 For example,
 in terms of model compliance and reliability,
 we have established
 a special financial security test
 to cover financial security,
 financial knowledge,
 and understanding
 to ensure that
 the model is reliable.
 In terms of application control and usability,
 we have established a special knowledge library
 to provide objective answers
 through the method of
 knowledge detection
 and red line problem response.
 In this way,
 we are able to
 provide objective solutions
 to the problem-solving problem.
 In terms of the risk of misuse,
 we have established a special financial security platform
 to provide objective answers
 and provide the source of the answers
 as a basis
 to achieve the application output results.
 The application of large models
 in the financial industry
 can be carried out
 from the following four aspects in the future.
 First,
 to develop large model
 technical support capabilities.
 Financial institutions should
 rely on their own capabilities
 to surround large model
 computing,
 algorithm,
 and data
 in three aspects
 to develop
 large model
 technical support capabilities.
 Second,
 to expand
 data asset construction.
 The application of large models
 is inseparable from
 the training of high-quality data.
 Financial institutions should
 pay attention to
 data asset storage
 and accumulation,
 and pay attention
 to data asset construction issues.
 In terms of data collection,
 storage,
 analysis,
 and application,
 and use,
 and other stages,
 to establish
 a comprehensive data management method,
 to establish
 a core concept
 of data drive,
 to break down
 the barriers of the industry,
 to promote
 data sharing
 and cooperation.
 Third,
 to build strong
 large model
 team.
 The application of
 AI large-model business
 is a
 comprehensive
 concept
 that was
 put in place
 in the early stage.
 Financial institutions should
 develop
 more
 comprehensive
 large-model
 smart Seung
��
 to adopt
 a
 more
 comprehensive
 and
 inclusive
 to accelerate the research and innovation of large-model technology in the financial industry,
 and strengthen the international competitiveness of our digital economy.
 That's all for my report. Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Let's give a round of applause to Chairman Lui for his wonderful sharing.
 We have seen the interest of the Chamber of Commerce in financial intelligence and digitalization,
 the attempts and explorations provided us with valuable experience.
 After listening to the wonderful sharing of our experts,
 we should have a more comprehensive understanding and demand for financial services.
 Next, our forum will publish two significant results.
 First, we will publish the digitalized service platform of the Chamber of Commerce in financial intelligence and digitalization.
 The Chamber of Commerce in financial intelligence and digitalization is a newly launched
 all-life cycle financial supervision service platform.
 First, let's take a look at it through a short video.
 Please look at the big screen.
 On the road of progress,
 the scenery changes along the way.
 What remains unchanged is that they have been on the road all the time.
 For Zhang,
 this is the road that is expected to be opened.
 The project is in full swing.
 The documents and materials are handed over layer by layer.
 The review process is繁琐,
 allowing the project to take a step forward.
 For Manager Sun,
 this is the road that will not be challenged.
 The business orders are not stopped.
 The payment is not late.
 If the payment of your company is not reached,
 there is no way to turn it around.
 It is difficult to withdraw the payment.
 The safety of the driver makes it difficult for him to turn left and right.
 For Manager Zhao,
 this is the road that is difficult to withdraw.
 The industry is in good shape.
 The investment capital cannot be clearly grasped.
 The management of the investment capital makes him anxious.
 For Xiao Li,
 this is the road that is in full swing.
 In the gym,
 the sweat spills
 only for the better self.
 The safety of the self.
 Don't worry.
 But the budget is large.
 The period is long.
 The safety of consumption
 makes him uncertain.
 No matter how the road ahead looks like,
 the management believes that
 there will always be beauty on the road.
 He set up the road for the management of the investment capital.
 He is flexible in the entry and exit accounts.
 He is one step faster in the development of the project.
 He sets up the road for the management of the investment capital.
 He has a good view of the safety of the investment capital.
 He is well-informed of the economic cycle.
 He doesn't worry about money,
 but he is carefree.
 He connects the road for the management of the investment capital,
 to grasp the capital sell.
 Light a new engine for the industry.
 He builds a road for the management of the investment capital,
 to embrace every love,
 to run to a good life,
 to sell cloth,

 让我们感受到了
 先进科技的震撼力量
 大模型金融应用
 已经从局部试点走向了全局战略
 也意识到了实施过程当中
 存在着技术瓶颈
 伦理挑战和治理的难题
 那么为了深入地讨论这些问题
 我们今天非常荣幸地邀请到了
 金融和科技领域的行业专家
 就大模型在金融业的战略布局
 以技术路径来进行讨论
 首先我们非常荣幸地邀请到了
 中国银行业协会首席信息官
 高峰作为本次圆桌论坛的主持人
 有请
 同时我为大家介绍我们今天
 圆桌论坛的四位嘉宾
 让我们掌声有请
 恒生电子董事长刘曙峰
 华为公司副总裁
 数字金融军团CEO曹冲
 微中银行行政助理
 首席财务官董事会秘书王立鹏
 蚂蚁集团研究院院长李振华
 有请各位
 有请
 下面我们把话筒
 交给
 高总
 各位领导
 各位嘉宾
 感谢交行的邀请
 接下来我与另外四位嘉宾
 一起围绕着大模型
 在银行或者金融领域的一些应用
 如何提高效率
 接下来我与另外四位嘉宾
 降低成本方面
 做一些头脑风暴
 首先我们看到
 自从2022年底
 拆掉GPT出事以来
 国人的心情和世界人民的心情不太一样
 金融业和非金融业
 人的感受也不太一样
 应该说
 中国的金融业和非金融业的感受也不太一样
 中国的金融业和非金融业的感受也不太一样
 大模型在非金融领域
 异常地兴奋和乐乎
 但是唯独在金融领域
 还是比较审慎
 因为强监管
 这种大环境下
 所以今天我想
 第一个问题还是请教曹总
 中国大模型距离先进国家
 现在差距很大
 问的问题就是
 中国
 为什么有必要
 建立自己信创的
 国产的底座的大模型
 有请曹总
 因为这个
 我们也是最近这一两年
 在加速
 其实我们看到
 模型的发展
 在18年的时候非常快
 那个时候只有1亿左右的参数
 对吧
 现在已经
 这个
 这个
 万亿
 甚至这个
 在进一步地在加速
 其实这个
 大家都知道
 我们说几个关键要素
 对吧
 这个
 数据
 算力
 对吧
 这几个
 都非常非常的重要
 那我想呢
 这个
 你讲到信创
 对当
 对当前
 因为我们各行各业都需要
 这个
 利用它的这种能力
 去
 因为大家看到它的价值
 这个
 无论是
 当前探索所看到的价值
 还有说对未来的价值
 都是巨大的
 对整个的这个
 各行各业
 无论是2B 2C
 这种流程
 生产的这种重促
 意义是巨大的
 其实刚才那个几位
 嘉宾领导分享的
 这个其实我们看得到
 小到我们的个人生活
 大到整个国家的这种
 社会发展的治理
 所以说
 这样的战略意义情况下
 我们认为
 这个
 这个
 在当今的形势下
 这种信创的
 必要性和严峻性
 是非常非常明显
 那我们
 最近这一两年呢
 在加速的这个过程中
 其实也有很多的感触
 感触
 就是说
 这个我们自己当然了
 我们自己有这种权战的方案
 有这个硬件的方案
 我们有模型开发框架
 也去年的
 这个九月份
 我们也发布了
 我们的金融行业的一些这个使用的一些场景的方案
 整个的下来呢
 我们还是有几点体会的
 我觉得第一个呢
 就是
 从进展上来看
 我们现在参与了像工行交行
 深交所这样头部
 这种联合的创新
 刚才也看到了我们交行
 这个我们也非常自豪
 我们深度参与了和交行
 在整个大模型上
 的联合的创新
 我们也取得了很多成果
 像目前我们已经在
 五十多个场景都取得了这样的成果
 比如说像我们这个信贷的助手
 我们已经呢
 能够把
 这个从我们信贷的这个
 全流程的来进出
 这个参与
 把过去的像这个
 两到三周的这么一个流程
 从报告的生成
 到这个审核
 到合规
 现在呢
 这个两三天来完成
 这个提升是
 其实是非常重要的
 非常非常大的
 那这么在整个过程中
 我们也就是感受到
 如果我们现在要推动
 我们自己的这种能力
 有几个点
 第一个我们认为
 这个基础模型的能力
 其实还是非常重要的
 我们一方面要强调
 场景其实是非常重要的
 但是我们认为基础能力
 也是非常非常重要的
 这个我们也是持续在增强
 像我们模型
 我们今年也发布了
 我们的盘古5.0
 这个基础的能力
 它对呢
 因为现在我们要越来越多
 我们发现要是处理的是
 越来越复杂的任务
 在这种情况下
 这个基础模型的能力
 是非常关键
 同时的话
 这个我们也看到
 多样智能
 也开始展现出
 它的价值和魅力
 因为我们一开始的是
 从NLP开始
 很多场景开始切入
 其实今天大量大家看到的
 这种场景化的应用
 也是从NLP
 这个角度
 在进行的
 当然也看到了价值
 但是我们觉得像CV
 这种模型
 像我们是NLP的模型
 CV的模型
 预测的模型
 科学计算的模型
 整个我们认为
 在这种多模态
 今天几位嘉宾也谈到了
 它的这种模型的组合
 的价值会越来越大
 比如说我们说这个预测
 我们在两三年前
 就跟一个券商就开始做
 利用这个预测模型
 去看它的整个的
 这个预测模型
 比如说财报的异常
 或者舞弊行为的判断
 通过模型的建模
 和对现有的这种舞弊案例
 进行分析
 那么我们今天进一步
 在增强我们的这种
 预测模型的能力
 我们现在发现
 比如说它在
 我们的资产负债调度上
 已经有了很好的应用
 像对一个
 比如说金融机构
 它的整个的资产的调度
 从总行分行
 我们像这个金融机构
 比如说日间的
 这种千亿的这种头寸
 我们现在利用预测模型
 它的这种误差率
 现在可以做到千分之六以下
 而且还能能演进
 所以说我用这个来举例
 就是说我们看到
 其实在多样智能的发展
 NLP
 其实我们说
 它的数学能力可能差一点
 那么我们通过多样智能
 比如说用预测模型
 把它的一个文科生的专长
 变成了一个全科生
 数学的能力也能提升
 所以说这个我们其实看到
 它的这种发展
 给我们带来的这种价值
 这种趋势是非常明确的
 好
 因为时间关系
 曹总的回答
 让我们对中国
 拥有自己的底座
 大模型底座
 充满了信心
 我不知道
 我们恒成董事长
 刘总咋想的
 我说的对不对
 你如果不用国外的
 这个模型底座
 用国产的
 比如华为的
 能不能支撑您的这个场景应用
 因为据我了解
 去年年底
 LiteDBT也发布了
 然后尤其在
 垂直领域的场景
 投盐投雇
 为券商
 包括为银行的财资
 这个领域服务
 您在应用场景里面
 肯定是专家
 所以我问您的问题
 第一个
 您跟曹总这边
 是不是适配
 第二个
 您在应用模型方面
 我不知道用的效果怎么样
 请您
 对
 首先我们确实跟华为
 是全面战略合作伙伴
 所以基础大模型
 也是适配的
 我们是从垂直领域
 金融领域的应用
 所以实际上
 我们这一年多的时间
 差不多快两年的时间
 我们跟新东院做了
 关于金融的大模型
 和金融大模型应用的
 测试的标准
 我觉得基于这个标准
 我们对所有的大模型
 不能说所有的
 主流的大模型
 进行了测试
 包括国际上
 包括开源
 和包括国产市场
 的基础模型
 国产现在也都很多开源出了
 所以测试的结果来看
 应该说这中间
 是有不同的表现
 尤其在金融领域
 经过预训练
 经过金条的结果
 也影响了它最终表现的输出
 但从最终的结果来看的话
 应该说差距
 不同的模型的差距是有的
 包括国内国外的差距
 还是有一定的差距的
 在不同的场景下面
 但是我们认为
 基本上都过了一个
 好用的这样的一个门槛
 换句话说
 在实际的应用结果来看
 基础模型的能力
 今天应该是够了
 在进入到
 比如说刚才讲到了
 我们把这个能力
 又具体细分为
 从意图理解
 从任务的执行
 到计算的决策
 从这些不同的视角来看
 尤其在前面两个
 我们觉得是能力的验证
 是通过的
 或者说超过了一般的
 平均的
 比如说投资顾问的
 这样的一些人员的水平
 您那个投研投顾模型
 我特别关心
 能提高效率
 能提高到什么程度
 百分之三十
 百分之五十
 这个
 我们从初步验证的结果来看
 在某些部位的效率
 大概能够提高到三倍
 三倍
 三倍以上
 还不能到一个数量级
 但是好几倍
 我们比如说有一个
 举个很简单的例子
 有一个运营的一个任务
 原来两天
 现在俩小时
 这个效果是明显的
 但是在计算决策方面
 刚才曹总也谈到了
 我觉得我们在这方面的能力应用
 看起来
 还有一定的挑战
 还有一个过程
 到底在应用
 在计算决策上面
 能不能达到一个
 比如说专家的平均水平
 我觉得还有待验证
 这是我们看下来的情况
 好
 谢谢刘总
 看来刘总是刚才说了
 基础模型能力
 逗了
 这个更有信心了
 这个
 就是说现在大模型
 整个世界也是这种趋势
 更关注的是在场景应用的能力
 市场转化能力
 所以呢
 微众银行一直是国内领先的
 这种互联网银行
 那么据我们了解
 微众银行也应用了
 这个曹总的底座
 包括类似于刘总的这样的应用的
 这个基础层或者平台层面的
 开层的一些模型
 当然呢这个
 微众呢也自创了
 自己也自创了自己的模型
 我想问这个去年中央金融工作会议啊
 这个以来啊
 五篇大文章
 这个是发展方向
 但是以大模型的视角
 怎么来看五篇大文章
 能够借力大模型能做得更好
 有请我们王首席啊
 好那个谢谢王首席啊
 谢谢高首席
 那个我借这个机会也分享一下
 微众银行在这落实五篇金融大文章的过程中
 使用大模型的一些体会和体验啊
 这个五篇金融大文章呢
 自打中央提出以后呢
 我们银行高度重视
 在各方面的都做了很多工作
 包括微众银行擅长的数字金融
 普惠金融
 这些方面吧
 我们都投入很多
 那么在一些特定的领域呢
 我们有一些智能化的应用啊
 可以和大家分享一下
 比如说在科创金融领域
 微众银行其实在科创科技金融方面呢
 投入是比较多的
 我们把我们的这个
 赋予小微企业的数字化信贷业务呢
 应用到了科创企业身上
 那么大家都知道啊
 微众银行的微业贷是一款典型的这个
 无抵押纯信用随借随还的便捷的线上的借贷产品
 它是利用了互联网大数据技术
 能够让这个用户呢
 在APP申请的时候呢
 实现这个
 秒级的借贷啊
 分钟级的授信和这个这个资金的到账使用
 那么它背后利用大量的这个智能技术
 那么我们把这类技术呢
 也推广到了科创企业这个领域
 那么能够快捷高效的服务科创企业啊
 科创金融企业
 那科创企业
 那么在这方面呢
 我们做了很多这有益的探索
 那么我们自己呢
 有一些这个跟科创相关的工具
 在使用的过程中呢
 觉得很有利益的
 也分享给我们的科创企业的客户
 我举个例子啊
 比如说在这个专利专利申请的书写上
 我们就利用大模型技术做了一些尝试
 微众银行呢
 是一家科创力行的企业
 所以我们呢
 到现在为止已经申请了很多专利了
 我们申请的专利数量达到四千多项
 那么每年呢
 有几百项
 就大几百项
 而且这个数量还在增加
 那在增加的这个过程中呢
 我们发现这个书写专利啊
 其实是可以自动化的一个领域
 所以我们就利用大模型技术
 开发了一个自动化书写专利的
 这么一个工具
 这工具我们自己的团队用起来
 还是挺顺手的
 所以我们把它呢
 也推荐给我们的科创企业
 我们的这个科创企业都是小微企业
 也就贷个几十万啊
 几百万这种这个水平的贷款
 经营规模都不是特别大
 他们完全没有能力
 自己开发这样的工具
 但是我们微众银行
 做了自己的这个智能专利书写工具以后
 开放给我们的科创企业客户去用
 那获得的评价和体验都还是蛮不错的啊
 这是一个不大的一个应用
 但是它很有价值
 对 王总我插一句
 这个就是在科技金融过程当中
 在服务科技企业的金融过程当中
 这个有人说啊
 这个专利啊
 银行用的大概占百分之二十到三十
 就是有些专利啊
 是不能作为融资的抵押的
 或者是说
 啊
 啊
 那么有您这个技术呢
 我觉得有个好处啊
 就是可以帮助帮助银行
 更能穿透式的啊
 甄别哪些专利技术可以作为银行的
 啊
 对那个您说的对
 实际上我们在对科技型企业进行授信的时候
 大家都知道我们微众银行的小微企业授信啊
 不是基于人和流程的
 它是基于大模机
 基于机器学习模型的
 我们这个授信所用到的模型超过上百个
 子模型的模型啊
 子模型数百个里面涉及到参数呃应该是万呃上万级别的
 所以它是一个自动化授信
 那么在对科技类型企业授信的时候
 我们除了参考一般的数据以外
 比如说工商司法税务水电煤气啊
 海关这个这个数据还有这个社保相关数据以外
 我们还会引入知识产权相关数据
 把专利啊和知识产权包括一些这个企业的外部信息
 集成到他的这个机器学习模型里在构建统一的模型
 所以考虑这个因素了
 好
 好的王总好时间关系那个我前不久我还听说交通银行也运用大模型技术在新同院的一个一个大赛上啊有一个叫一加一加恩就是如何甄别什么是科技型企业因为现在工信部人民银行发改委等等对这个科技型企业的评判的标准不一样所以银行有点方崩啊那就是在选科技型企业的时候用有大模型可能就会很好
 这个刚才啊这个几位领导讲了这个底层技术的应用啊底层技术与长领用这些都是威尔的可能是通过金融资源来去赋能实体经济的最近的我发现这个我们蚂蚁啊做了一件非金融的事情就是除了去年发布的上海外团大会发布的这个大模型叫知知知小宝啊
 还有知晓还有知晓住对一个是对客户的对员工的那么最近发现阿里在医疗健康哎生活包括生活顾问啊除了金融方面都有些管家也是利用大模型技术所以我想今天因为来的很多企业家啊所以想请我们郑华院长介绍介绍这个除了金融之外
 阿里
 哪些新的啊
 用大模型技术啊
 新的产品和服务
 好
 呃
 其实不是阿里啊
 这个阿里的同意签问这个跟蚂蚁的大模型是两回事啊
 这个我简要介绍一下
 这个蚂蚁这边
 我觉得在现在的呃这个行业应用当中呢
 我想有几个层面啊
 那么一个层面是
 我们把大模型
 用把它用作这个
 这个效率的工具啊
 或者是把它叫做叫生产力工具啊
 这个是在很多用在通用场景当中的
 那么这是一种
 那么第二个呢
 就是把它这个用到这个行业当中啊
 行业当中它还是一个2B的服务
 但是在行业当中呢会做的更纵深一点结合行业的私有数据再加上行业的这个场景然后就做进一步的服务
 当然第三个呢
 其实大家也都在探索
 对C的直接服务啊是不是这个可以创造新的这个流量的入口是吧
 另外再加上它有完全不同于以往的在移动互联时代的这个应用
 那我觉得在第一个层面上我们也在也在探索也在看啊这个呃在这个生产效率的工具这个那我觉得当然这个可得使用的这个这个性能动力的这个应用也要比较多的我认为是第一个层面上我们也在也在探索也在看啊这个在这个生产效率的工具这个那我觉得当然这个可得使用这些动力的这个应用也有很多啊
 There are two more mature tools that you may have seen.
 The first one is the code tool.
 Recently, BIAS and we have done a joint study
 on the code fields of ants.
 It has done a research on the internal and external
 partner scene applications.
 It has found that it can improve the efficiency of code generation
 by more than 50%.
 This has been applied in many scenarios.
 The second one is customer service.
 I don't need to talk about this.
 In the future, I think, including now,
 many commercial banks and many companies are using it.
 The second one is some of the deep applications
 in the industry.
 Sometimes it may be applied to customers
 to do some kind of
 integration.
 We are thinking about
 whether we can form an effective
 integration with customers.
 So, last year, BIAS
 became a financial steward.
 The core is that Zhi Xiaobao
 is able to go beyond the big model
 in the financial field
 to connect the ability of dialogue
 and the identification of intentions
 and emotions.
 He can really make it into
 a user-invested steward.
 The second one is in the field of medical health.
 I think it is a combination of the applications
 in the industry,
 some private data,
 ants, because they have received
 a lot of medical insurance in the past,
 and the hospital of the Internet, etc.
 I hope to be able to put the micro-science
 and the hospital of the Internet
 in the future.
 There are many electronic data
 that can be used to
 really help people who are in need
 to go from the division
 to the various processes in the hospital
 and to the future
 of their own health management
 to be able to create a steward for them.
 Such services.
 I think it is the same for life.
 I don't want to talk too much.
 Let's take a look at OpenAI.
 In its first attempt,
 it made a plug-in.
 What is the core method of the plug-in?
 It hopes to make an entrance at the front end
 through OpenAI's direct dialogue entrance.
 And then,
 it speaks out your needs.
 From the natural language to the back end,
 it collects the applications of N plus,
 and then makes automatic transactions.
 Later, it gave up this route.
 It made GPT-S.
 But in fact,
 this idea can be done
 in the field of vertical.
 In the future,
 I think it is possible
 that in many fields of vertical life,
 it can open up many applications,
 but not in the current small-scale way,
 but in the automated way,
 to change the social logic of the past.
 I think this will make life more convenient.
 Yes.
 In fact, Dean Zheng Hua talked about a thought just now.
 It is that
 it may be a little narrow
 to just be a financial steward.
 If we do some non-financial fields,
 such as life steward,
 as well as medical and health steward,
 in fact,
 it is a blessing for the entire financial field.
 It is equivalent to
 a bank doing a non-financial business
 that is conducive to financial growth.
 I think this is also a new way of thinking.
 If one day,
 a bank creates a large-scale application,
 not for financial products,
 but for life,
 I think this is also a very good service.
 Right?
 I think this is another way of thinking.
 So, just now,
 we talked about the topic of technology and applications.
 We still have some time.
 Next,
 we will talk about
 how to manage innovation.
 In terms of innovation,
 I noticed that
 Hengsheng Electronics
 also talked about AI Agents
 just now.
 Director Lv also talked about AI Agents.
 AI Agents,
 I think,
 are very beautiful.
 They are easy to understand.
 However,
 there seems to be a gap
 in the real world.
 In reality,
 it is not like what we are talking about.
 AI is more like a story.
 It is more like a story.
 However,
 in reality,
 there may be a distance.
 So, I really want to hear
 Director Lv talk about
 whether it is the financial industry
 or the non-financial industry,
 when we are
 correcting big models,
 right?
 We can use AI Agents
 to make it real.
 Another point is that
 someone said
 if quantum and quantum
 can be combined with AI Agents,
 it will have the effect of
 quick connection
 and will be able to shorten the radius.
 In this regard,
 I think you have some opinions.
 Can you share them with us?
 We just talked about
 the ability of basic models
 to make the process
 and the result presented
 in the scene.
 I think this ability
 can be verified.
 This is what we have seen today.
 OK.
 For example,
 for example,
 we are more focused on
 financial asset management.
 Yes.
 So, the work of financial consultants.
 Yes.
 Right?
 The big model of AI,
 from what we have verified today,
 the big model can be
 more than the average
 of the customer's income.
 Not revenue.
 Revenue is not enough.
 Revenue is another problem.
 What I am talking about is
 this kind of understanding.
 For example,
 understanding the client's intention.
 Understanding the client's intention.
 Understanding the client's intention.
 This is not only about
 communication.
 Especially,
 if you add the personal data
 of the client,
 for example,
 the pool.
 I think in this understanding,
 it is more than
 the average level.
 It is obvious.
 I personally think
 more than 80%
 of the investment
 of the client
 can be seen.
 It can be expected.
 And it is fast.
 Actually,
 I think
 it is almost
 more than 80%
 of the investment
 of the client.
 But,
 can it really
 go online
 and produce?
 This involves
 the problem of
 compliance.
 It involves
 the problem of
 data preparation.
 Yes.
 It involves
 the problem of
 continuity of service.
 So,
 I think
 this
 is
 on the edge
 of
 sustainability.
 Especially,
 when you have
 a big outbreak,
 we are now
 in this
 small range
 of verification
 environment.
 The number of outbreaks
 is not large.
 There may be hundreds
 of clients.
 But,
 if
 there are
 100,000
 or millions
 of clients,
 the number
 of outbreaks
 will be larger
 in the case
 of ants.
 So,
 how far
 can this go?
 How far
 can this go?
 This problem
 may not be
 a technical problem
 of the model itself.
 It is
 a problem
 of data preparation
 in our actual
 production environment.
 The accuracy
 of the data
 and the continuity
 of the blurred
 answers
 include
 how to solve
 some illusion
 problems
 to a certain extent.
 Including
 business logic problems.
 Including
 business logic problems.
 So,
 in this process,
 our solution today
 is based on
 the application development
 of various financial institutions.
 The second
 is based
 on the application
 scene
 and data
 connection
 and the execution
 of various applications.
 But,
 the problem
 is that
 the original
 application services
 and the services
 of the back end
 and the services
 of the middle and the back end
 are not completely
 atomicized.
 So,
 the efficiency
 of the call
 is relatively low.
 This efficiency
 has a solution.
 I think
 this is
 our stage.
 This is the problem
 we need to
 further explore
 and solve
 in this stage.
 This process
 is relatively
 extensive.
 I think
 how long
 does it take
 for us
 to explore?
 But,
 I think
 it will be
 very fast.
 Because
 the ability
 has already
 been verified.
 The rest
 is the boundary.
 It is a
 engineering problem.
 This is the second.
 The third
 is the question
 about
 agent.
 The third is
 the further
 improvement
 of the ability
 of the front-end
 application.
 That is,
 I put the ability
 of the big model
 directly
 to the front-end.
 From the agent
 to realize
 what we
 talked about today,
 maybe
 based on
 this
 quantity
 data
 and so on,
 including
 knowledge maps,
 and so on,
 I use
 AI
 and agent
 to replace
 this part of work.
 We call it
 light.
 Today,
 we call it
 connector.
 Some
 are called
 Compilator.
 Compilator
 becomes a
 comprehensive agent.
 The agent itself
 has intelligence.
 The agent itself
 is trained.
 At this time,
 there may be
 differences
 between agents.
 There will be
 a diversification
 of applications.
 Maybe
 the basic model
 is similar,
 but the agent
 is different.
 In the front-end
 agent,
 it may be
 diversified
 and enter
 a new stage.
 This is also
 worth looking forward to.
 This is the direction of the future.
 I think so.
 I personally think so.
 I personally think
 in the next few years,
 maybe,
 so I have a point of view.
 Today,
 we talk about
 large model applications.
 Maybe in the future,
 will it enter
 a state of comprehensive agent?
 Everyone has
 an assistant.
 This assistant
 is not just
 helping you to solve tasks.
 It can also
 lead your task.
 Yes.
 This intelligence
 is even closer.
 Thank you,
 Mr. Liu.
 You speak very well.
 With the large model,
 this application
 and promotion,
 more and more banks
 start to doubt
 financial institutions
 or
 various companies.
 What do they doubt?
 When
 will this investment
 be effective?
 Is it
 invalid?
 Is it
 immovable?
 So,
 among the four guests
 invited today,
 Mr. Wang
 used to work
 at Star.
 So,
 I asked him
 a difficult question.
 I asked him
 how to use
 the perspective of
 CFO
 to consider
 the effect of
 large model investment
 and output.
 What kind of
 KPI index
 do you use?
 So,
 do you have any
 suggestions?
 Well,
 I think
 everyone in this field
 is trying to figure it out.
 The application of AI
 in the financial industry
 and the application
 in the industry,
 whether it is
 the front or the back,
 it has several
 outstanding characteristics.
 It is high investment,
 high risk,
 and
 high output.
 It has such a characteristic.
 So,
 from this point of view,
 in terms of
 AI investment,
 its investment and output ratio
 is challenging.
 And
 in every application scenario,
 there may be
 different methodologies.
 We are also
 searching for this.
 But
 I think
 the direction of
 AI investment
 must be firm.
 This
 must ensure
 the strength of investment,
 but it also
 needs
 certain control.
 So,
 the main way
 we use
 in practice
 is to have
 a certain budget control
 to prevent
 it from
 consuming
 without boundaries.
 But in this process,
 the necessary patience
 is necessary.
 Because any
 technical adaptation
 requires a process.
 This process
 may be longer.
 It does have
 a probability of failure
 and a higher probability
 of failure.
 But once it succeeds,
 it may bring
 a great boost
 to productivity.
 So,
 in the process of
 using it,
 we still need
 to be patient.
 So,
 I suggested to Chairman Wang
 how to evaluate
 and consider
 the effect.
 Of course,
 it depends on the stage.
 It depends on
 the resources
 combined with
 the capital.
 Big banks
 and small banks
 are still different.
 Just now,
 I will provide
 an example
 about
 the question
 of investment
 and output ratio.
 Just now,
 Zhenghua also mentioned
 the generation
 of codes.
 Right?
 We use
 the big model
 for the generation
 of codes.
 Of course,
 we need to make
 some investments.
 But,
 if we actually
 look at it,
 the investment
 is actually
 very small.
 When it is mature,
 there is not much
 investment.
 But,
 you can
 increase
 the efficiency
 of each
 engineer
 with the code.
 If you increase
 the efficiency
 by 50%,
 it will be
 more profitable.
 Good.
 Very good.
 I would like
 to add
 a point of view.
 In the past,
 the investment period
 of the big model technology
 was very strong.
 We have
 drawn a number.
 In 2023,
 in the global
 big model,
 including hardware,
 software,
 and applications,
 the cost
 of each
 enterprise
 is
 about
 $6.7 billion.
 Of course,
 the proportion
 of hardware
 is
 higher now.
 But,
 there is
 less
 investment
 in other
 industries.
 I think
 this is
 the case
 with
 enterprises.
 In China,
 the cost
 is
 very low.
 In fact,
 it is mainly
 the US.
 In China,
 the whole
 industry
 is
 spending
 hundreds of
 billions
 of RMB
 on hardware.
 This is
 what
 I said
 myself.
 In fact,
 it is not
 the time
 for
 enterprises
 to spend
 a lot of money
 on software
 and applications
 in the ecosystem.
 They are all hardware.
 In fact,
 I think
 for
 the
 big model
 low-level
 model,
 it is very
 expensive.
 But,
 for the
 application
 enterprises,
 I think
 it is not
 the time.
 Okay.
 I would like to ask
 the next speaker
 for
 the
 question.
 This question
 is for
 Mr.
 Kwok backwards.
 I don't think
 Mr.
 Kwok
 is
 interested
 in
 the
 question.
 What is
 your
 opinion
 on
 this topic?
 Mr.
 Kwok,
 do you
 have
 any
 comment
 on
 the
 financial
 So at this time, we need to focus on the outside world,
 and look outwards.
 That's what Mr. Xiao mentioned earlier.
 Zhenghua is in the Institute of Research,
 and he has done a lot of research abroad.
 I especially want to hear about the financial industry,
 because it's different from other industries.
 I'm just kidding.
 In terms of unmanned aerial vehicles,
 it's unmanned aerial vehicles.
 But in the financial industry,
 you need to have aerial vehicles.
 It's different.
 It feels different.
 So the AI in the manufacturing industry
 is different from the AI in the judgment.
 What are some good management suggestions
 in the financial industry for the large model of AI in the manufacturing industry
 to approach foreign experience?
 Please tell us.
 Yes, actually, in the field of AI,
 when it comes to applications in the industry,
 there are two industries that are the most sensitive.
 One is the financial industry,
 and the other is the medical and health industry.
 One is the highly privacy of data.
 The other is directly related to life and health,
 or directly related to the security of your funds and assets.
 These two industries are all very sensitive.
 I think, from a global perspective,
 in these two areas,
 I think it's basically a thought.
 It's just that each country may not be the same.
 I think in the European Union,
 it will be a thought in the division of control of AI.
 In fact, President Xiao probably mentioned it just now.
 The so-called, he thinks,
 the basic thought is that,
 for the present,
 I think the application of AI is still at a relatively initial stage.
 It needs to balance its innovation and development relationship.
 However, for the entire industry's risk,
 it cannot be effectively controlled.
 So the core is to do the supervision of classification and classification.
 In the European Union, there are four categories.
 One is the risk that is absolutely unacceptable.
 One is the risk that is absolutely unacceptable.
 Two is the risk that is unacceptable.
 The risk of high risk and low risk.
 Basically, no risk at all.
 Then there's the industry which is strictly controlled.
 Then there are the industry which is strictly controlled.
 And these two types.
 That is, the risk that is unacceptable and high risk.
 So in this area,
 it is probably more important in the field of medical health and finance.
 But in these fields, it's very difficult to say.
 So I would rather not talk about the other categories.
 So I would rather not talk about the other categories.
 I think this is one of the overseas ideas.
 The second idea is that, as we have all talked about in the AI presentation,
 this industry, including the path of technological development,
 is highly uncertain.
 This industry, including the models and so on,
 is very, very complex.
 So it is a process of continuous improvement.
 So it is very difficult to recognize all the risks in advance
 and to control them effectively.
 It is very difficult.
 So I think overseas is basically a...
 What we are exploring, especially in the US,
 is a shared idea of supervision and industry.
 A shared idea.
 For the US,
 it is basically...
 I am going to give more hints about the risks,
 rather than limiting the entry
 as the main idea of supervision.
 In addition,
 it will allow the industry to do some self-reliant things
 and then the government and industry
 will continue to deal with them
 to form a more perfect supervision idea.
 The third point, the last point,
 I think the last point,
 in the financial industry,
 it is indeed very complex.
 So I think it is basically similar to overseas and domestic.
 It is the process of making financial decisions directly,
 as far as possible,
 as far as possible.
 It is not directly related to decision-making,
 such as tools and so on.
 This can be put aside as much as possible.
 The last point is that
 the countermeasures,
 directly dealing with countermeasures,
 may involve privacy issues,
 financial security issues,
 and so on.
 This can also be put back.
 The supervision will be stricter.
 I think this is probably the idea.
 Thank you.
 You also mentioned a technical route.
 I think it is correct.
 In fact, today,
 I have invited four guests.
 I think it is very special.
 Mr. Cao is the center.
 What you are doing now is Ecos.
 It is ecology.
 Everyone is surrounding you,
 going up and down.
 And then,
 in addition to the technical side,
 it also comes from the application,
 from the use,
 from the research institutions,
 and from the industry,
 from the association.
 So it is very similar to today's meeting topic.
 It is very similar to today's meeting topic.
 China's artificial intelligence development path,
 how to develop features,
 may be really different from those abroad.
 What do we need?
 We need AI to do well.
 We need open consensus.
 We need ethical ethics.
 Okay.
 Thank you for your time today.
 Thank you again.
 Okay.
 Let's give a round of applause
 to our five guests
 for bringing us
 wonderful discussions and discussions.
 We are very inspired.
 Thank you, everyone.
 Please take a seat.
 Thank you, everyone.
 Thank you, everyone.
 Friends,
 today,
 we have a special session
 for our press conference,
 press conference,
 and the final forum.
 It makes us feel that
 under the wave of technology,
 we are actually related to each other.
 We are not spectators.
 We are builders,
 and we are beneficiaries.
 So I also hope that
 we can work together
 to defend innovation,
 to contribute our strength
 to the construction of a financially strong country
 and the welfare of mankind
 in order to help our country.
 So I also hope that
 in the future,
 everyone can pay more attention
 to the development of the transportation bank
 in the field of artificial intelligence
 and digital transformation
 in the future.
 Friends, this is the end of today's forum.
 Thank you for your participation.
 See you next time.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
